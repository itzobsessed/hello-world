# Moving Average Trading Algorithm
Python program to that uses moving average for different time periods as a measure to predict whether a stock is under-valued or over-valued also considering past stock price actions. The goal of the program was to indicate whether to buy call or put options for a stock and guarantee with at least 90% accuracy a profitable trade. The program was initially written with Jupyter notebooks IDE powered by Anaconda but was transferred to Google Colaboratory.
